python GraphQL parser and django ORM integration

a highly experimental, probably buggy and limited proof-of-concept for GraphQL parsing and integration with the Django ORM.

to try it out:

- download code
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- python scratchpad.py

You should see a GraphQL response :)

The GraphQL parser uses parsimonious (https://github.com/erikrose/parsimonious) and generates a simple AST that is converted to Django ORM queries
